         <div class="h3">TRAX Light Rail</div>

            <p><a href="http://www.rideuta.com/mc/?page=UTA-Home-AppCenter">Utah Transit Authority mobile apps.</a></p>

	    <p>TRAX Light Rail leaves from the Airport's Terminal 1 area every 15 minutes, and takes approximately 24 minutes. The "Green Line" provides service to the airport and downtown before continuing on to West Valley.</p>

	    <p>Exit at "Courthouse Station" (the 10th stop after leaving the airport -- you pass through downtown first).</p>

	    <p>The exit stop is across the street from Little America Hotel, so walking is minimal.</p>

	    <p>The fare is $2.00. Pay before you board. Cash and credit cards are accepted at the automated ticketing machines.</p>

	    <p>This is generally the favored mode of getting from the airport to downtown destinations, including Little America.</p>

	<div class="h3">Taxi</div>

	    <p>Taxi service from the Salt Lake International Airport to the Little America Hotel takes about 15 minutes, and costs approximately $20-25, not including tip.</p>

	<div class="h3">Car Rental</div>

	    <p>If you're staying downtown you won't need a car. If you
	       plan to do much exploring beyond downtown Salt Lake City,
               you may prefer to rent a car. Parking at Little America Hotel is free
               for conference attendees. Parking at other locations downtown is
               relatively inexpensive when compared to other major cities.  There are
               several rental options available on the <a

               International Airport web site.</a></p>
