            <p>YAPC::NA and Infinity Interactive are proud to announce "From Zero to
                Perl," a special course for programmers new to the Perl programming
                language, to be taught by John "genehack" Anderson on Sunday the 7th
                June.</p>


                <p>The "Zero To Perl" course is designed to introduce programmers of any
                experience level to Perl 5 programming. (Non-programmers are welcomed
                as well!) This one-day course will give you the basic skills you'll
                need to program in Perl for a variety of tasks, including Web
                development, text processing, bioinformatics, database manipulation,
                systems administration, devops, and more.</p>

            <a class="hideshow-reveal" href="#">Show more</a>
            <div class="hideshow-hidden" style="display: none">
                <p>The course will cover basic Perl syntax, including variables and data
                structures, flow control, functions, reading and writing files, and
                regular expressions. Instruction will be interspersed with hands-on
                sessions where you'll put into practice the concepts that you have
                just learned. Instructors will be available to give each student
                direct assistance as needed.</p>

                <p>After completing this course, you'll be ready to start writing your
                own Perl programs and you'll be perfectly positioned to enjoy the rest
                of YAPC::NA, even if this is your first exposure to Perl.</p>

                <p>Course Preparations:</p>

                <p>Students should bring a laptop, ideally with Perl and a programmer's
                text editor (such as Vim, Emacs, Sublime Text, Notepad 2, etc.)
                already installed. Be prepared for an intense day of hands on
                learning. Code samples and course materials will be provided on site</p>

                <p>About the Instructor:</p>

                <p>John SJ Anderson has been using Perl for over fifteen years, since
                teaching it to himself as part of a desperate plan to finish his
                graduate work. He's been teaching computing concepts and introductory
                Perl and BioPerl to bioinformatics students at The Johns Hopkins
                University for the last ten years. In his free time, John contributes
                to several Open Source projects, moderates the perl-beginners mailing
                list, and organizes the Salem Oregon Dynamic Languages Users Group.</p>

            <p>Join us for an interactive hands-on course all about Moose, an OO
                system for Perl 5 that provides a simple declarative layer of "sugar"
                on top of a powerful, extensible meta-model.</p>

                <p>With Moose, simple classes can be created without writing any
                subroutines, and complex classes can be simplified. Moose's features
                include a powerful attribute declaration system, type constraints and
                coercions, method modifiers ("before", "after", and "around"), a role
                system (like mixins on steroids), and more. Moose also has a vibrant
                ecosystem of extensions as seen in the variety of MooseX:: modules on
                CPAN.</p>

                <p>This course will cover Moose's core features, go in depth on many of
                them, and explore some of the more powerful MooseX:: modules available
                on CPAN.</p>

                <p>This is a hands-on course. Each lecture section is followed by a
                hands-on exercise section where you put what you've just learned into
                practice. The instructor will work with each student individually as
                needed to help you get the most from these exercises.</p>

                <p>Students are expected to bring a laptop. You will also be provided
                with a tarball a week or so before the class is scheduled. This will
                contain the exercises for the class.</p>

                <p>This class has consistently received excellent evaluations from
                students who've taken it:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li> "I thought Dave's class was outstanding. Well prepared and highly
                valuable content. This course was one of the best organized I've had
                the opportunity to take." - Chris Fedde

                    <li> "It damn sure was a good use! It would've been a huge mistake not
                taking your class; Moose is a magnificent beast and I couldn't have
                picked a better primer." - Brian Fraser

                    <li> "The class was great. There was a nice balance of material presented
                to hands-on experimentation, and alternating between lecture and
                exercises helped nail down concepts." - Philip Monsen
                </ul>

                <p>Course Length: 1 full day</p>

                <p>Intended Audience: This class is aimed at Perl programmers who
                understand object-oriented programming and want to learn how to do it
                with Moose. It is not suitable for Perl beginners or for people
                without any OO experience. OO experience in other languages besides
                Perl is sufficient, as long as you also have a good grasp of Perl
                syntax, particularly method call syntax.</p>

                <p>Supplies Provided: I will provide a tarball via email containing the
                class exercises.</p>

                <p>Supplies Needed: Students are expected to bring a laptop with a recent
                version of Perl and the editor of their choice.</p>

                <p>There are a few million new languages making buzz on the Internet
                these days, and Go is one of them! Go hits a nice sweet spot between
                ease of coding, speed of execution, and modern features such as type
                inferencing, concurrency, and a minimalist but well-designed OO
                system.</p>

                <p>In this class, I'll introduce you to Go basics including syntax, the
                type system, OO in Go, packages and package management, and

		<p>The primary focus of this course is client-side web development.</p>
		
		<p>You are going to learn how to create a mobile-enabled, responsive web
		application using the following pieces of technology:
		HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript, <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>,
		<a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a>, and <a 
		href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> on the front-end.</p>

		<p>We are also going to use <a href="https://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> and
		<a href="http://perldancer.org/">Perl Dancer 2</a> on the server.</p>

	    	<h5>Class Description</h5>

		<p>At the beginning of the course we are going to introduce the
		basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  We'll touch on some of the
		features that are usually mentioned as HTML5 some of which are
		actually part of JavaScript.</p>

		<p>Then we are going to take an already existing web-site that
		provides an API sending data formatted as JSON, and we are
		going to write a single-page client-side application for it.</p>

		<p>Finally we are going to build a small server-side
		application using Perl Dancer 2 and MongoDB.</p>

		<h5>Audience</h5>

		<p>This course is for you if from time to time you need to
		build internal web applications, or if you'd like to convert a
		CGI based application to modern technologies, or if you just
		want to be the next Twitter or Facebook.</p></p></p></p>

		<p>The course is 2 days long.</p>

		<p>Participants are expected at least intermediate knowledge of
		Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP, or some other high-level language. As
		a minimum they are expected to understand arrays, hashes
		(called dictionaries in Python and associative arrays in PHP).</p>

		<p>The students will get the training material in PDF format
		and they will get plenty of example files. They are expected to
		bring their own computer running Linux, Unix, OSX, or MS
		Windows.  More specific instructions will be given a few days
		prior to the training class.</p>
