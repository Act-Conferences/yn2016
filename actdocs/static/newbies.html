        <p>Perl is a thriving language backed by an active community that continues

        Perl Conference (also affectionately referred to as
        &quot;YAPC::NA&quot;) is the premiere North American event featuring
        training, workshops, hackathons for all things Perl and for all skill

        <p>A:  This must be the first time you have attended YAPC.  You must submit
        your request to admin@yapcna.org by April 10th, 2016 12:01:00 AM EST.
        There are a very limited number of these offers (four, total).  We will
        choose at random from those who make their request in time.  If you are
        chosen you will be contacted by email with instructions on how to
        register.  Because we want to be sure that those who are awarded this
        tremendous savings actually use it, part of your registration will
        require that you forward your travel arrangements.  Failure to follow
        through in registering or in forwarding travel arrangements in a timely
        manner will result in someone else being randomly chosen in your place.</p>

        <p>The request email must include your name and contact information.
        One request per person.</p>

        <p>The hotel room rate will be covered, but upon checking-in to the
        hotel the registrant will need to present a credit card to the hotel
        for incidentals, additional nights, and any applicable taxes and fees.
        Travel, parking, and food expenses are not covered by this offer.</p>

        <p>All attendees of YAPC::NA::2016 must be registered to attend the
        conference, and must abide by the Standards of Conduct as outlined on
        the YAPC::NA website. This offer is non-refundable and
        non-transferrable.</p>

        to attend YAPC (hotel and Zero to Perl class not included) for $50.

        <p>A:  Yes.   This program is inspired by the Enlightened Perl
        Organization's <a href="http://www.send-a-newbie.enlightenedperl.org/">"Send A Newbie"</a> 
        program and has been done in the past at
        YAPC::EU and YAPC::Asia.   However, this offer is not connected to the
        EPO's initiative.
