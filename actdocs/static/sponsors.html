<p>The best way to sponsor YAPC is through a sponsorship to The Perl Foundation.    By sponsoring TPF, not only do you get recognition for your support of YAPC::NA, but you are also recognized as a sponsor of our regional Perl Workshops, our Outreach Program for Women, beginner training initiatives, and our grants programs for an entire year.   It really is the way to get the most value for your sponsorship money. </p>

<p>The donation prospectus for The Perl Foundation may be found <a href="http://donate.perlfoundation.org/prospectus.html">here.</a></p>

<p>Sponsors interested in sponsoring only YAPC should email <a href="mailto:treasurer@perlfoundation.org">treasurer@perlfoundation.org.</a>   We are usually able to work things out on a case by case basis depending on your needs.  Often, we will pick out a particular aspect of running the conference that matches the sponsors' budget ( Wi-fi, Social event, Coffee break, etc.. ) and give the sponsor recognition for providing that element of the event.</p>

<p>Any sponsorship amount over $500 entitles the sponsor to a table at our sponsor expo and job fair.   One complimentary pass to YAPC is provided for each $1,000 donated.  Representatives that are only staying for the job fair do not need to have a pass.</p>
