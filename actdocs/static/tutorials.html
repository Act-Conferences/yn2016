                <p>Sawyer X has been a core developer of Dancer probably too quickly
                after it came into the world. He has led Dancer and now leads the new
                branch of Dancer: Dancer2. He's the current project leader and main
                developer.</p>

                <p>Mickey is a core developer in Dancer2 and has provided some of the
                bigger changes including major overhaults of core components, along
                with massive cleanups of the inner workings of Dancer.</p>

                <p>Both Sawyer and Mickey currently work on Dancer (amongst other
                projects) at Booking.com.</p>

            <p> YAPC::NA is proud to announce "From Zero to Perl," a special
            course for programmers new to the Perl programming language, to be
            taught by John "Genehack" Anderson on Sunday the 19th of June.</p>

                <p>The "Zero To Perl" course is designed to introduce programmers of any
                experience level to Perl 5 programming. (Non-programmers are welcomed
                as well!) This one-day course will give you the basic skills you'll
                need to program in Perl for a variety of tasks, including Web
                development, text processing, bioinformatics, database manipulation,
                systems administration, devops, and more.</p>

            <a class="hideshow-reveal" href="#FZTP">Show more</a>
            <div class="hideshow-hidden" style="display: none">
                <p>The course will cover basic Perl syntax, including variables and data
                structures, flow control, functions, reading and writing files, and
                regular expressions. Instruction will be interspersed with hands-on
                sessions where you'll put into practice the concepts that you have
                just learned. Instructors will be available to give each student
                direct assistance as needed.</p>

                <p>After completing this course, you'll be ready to start writing your
                own Perl programs and you'll be perfectly positioned to enjoy the rest
                of YAPC::NA, even if this is your first exposure to Perl.</p>

                <h5>Course Preparations:</h5>

                <p>Students should bring a laptop, ideally with Perl and a programmer's
                text editor (such as Vim, Emacs, Sublime Text, Notepad 2, etc.)
                already installed. Be prepared for an intense day of hands on
                learning. Code samples and course materials will be provided on site</p>

            <p>Join us for an interactive hands-on course all about Moose, an OO
                system for Perl 5 that provides a simple declarative layer of "sugar"
                on top of a powerful, extensible meta-model.</p>

                <p>With Moose, simple classes can be created without writing any
                subroutines, and complex classes can be simplified. Moose's features
                include a powerful attribute declaration system, type constraints and
                coercions, method modifiers ("before", "after", and "around"), a role
                system (like mixins on steroids), and more. Moose also has a vibrant
                ecosystem of extensions as seen in the variety of MooseX:: modules on
                CPAN.</p>

                <p>This course will cover Moose's core features, go in depth on many of
                them, and explore some of the more powerful MooseX:: modules available
                on CPAN.</p>
            <a class="hideshow-reveal" href="#Moose">Show more</a>
            <div class="hideshow-hidden" style="display: none">
                <p>This is a hands-on course. Each lecture section is followed by a
                hands-on exercise section where you put what you've just learned into
                practice. The instructor will work with each student individually as
                needed to help you get the most from these exercises.</p>

                <p>Students are expected to bring a laptop. You will also be provided
                with a tarball a week or so before the class is scheduled. This will
                contain the exercises for the class.</p>

                <p>This class has consistently received excellent evaluations from
                students who've taken it:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li> "I thought Dave's class was outstanding. Well prepared and highly
                valuable content. This course was one of the best organized I've had
                the opportunity to take." - Chris Fedde

                    <li> "It damn sure was a good use! It would've been a huge mistake not
                taking your class; Moose is a magnificent beast and I couldn't have
                picked a better primer." - Brian Fraser

                    <li> "The class was great. There was a nice balance of material presented
                to hands-on experimentation, and alternating between lecture and
                exercises helped nail down concepts." - Philip Monsen
                </ul>

                <p>Intended Audience: This class is aimed at Perl programmers who
                understand object-oriented programming and want to learn how to do it
                with Moose. It is not suitable for Perl beginners or for people
                without any OO experience. OO experience in other languages besides
                Perl is sufficient, as long as you also have a good grasp of Perl
                syntax, particularly method call syntax.</p>

                <p>Supplies Provided: I will provide a tarball via email containing the
                class exercises.</p>

                <p>Supplies Needed: Students are expected to bring a laptop with a recent
                version of Perl and the editor of their choice.</p>

                <p>Dave Rolsky has been a Perl developer since 1999, and has created or
                contributed to dozens of CPAN modules. He is a member of the Moose
                core development team, and in early 2009 completed a TPF grant to

                <p>There are a few million new languages making buzz on the Internet
                these days, and Go is one of them! Go hits a nice sweet spot between
                ease of coding, speed of execution, and modern features such as type
                inferencing, concurrency, and a minimalist but well-designed OO
                system.</p>

                <p>In this class, I'll introduce you to Go basics including syntax, the
                type system, OO in Go, packages and package management, and
                concurrency.</p>

                <p>This is a hands-on course. Each lecture section is followed by a hands-on
                exercise section where you put what you've just learned into practice. The
                instructor will work with each student individually as needed to help you
                get the most from these exercises.</p>

                <p>Students are expected to bring a laptop. You will also be provided with a
                tarball a week or so before the class is scheduled. This will contain the
                exercises for the class.</p>

                <h5>Intended Audience</h5>

                <p>This class is aimed at anyone who wants to learn
                Go. I will assume that you have experience programming in at least one
                other language, but no assumption are made about what language that
                is, nor are you expected to be familiar with Go.</p>

                <p>Supplies Provided: I will provide a tarball via email containing the class
                exercises.</p>

                <p>Supplies Needed: Students are expected to bring a laptop with the most
                recent version of Go installed and an editor of their choice.</p>
