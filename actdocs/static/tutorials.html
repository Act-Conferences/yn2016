            <p>Perl 6 is a new production-ready multi-paradigm language in the
            Perl family. It offers everything from low-level bitwise operations
            on raw bytes, to a full range of built-in system commands, to
            hygenic source code macros, to direct symbol-table introspection
            and manipulation, to run-time composition of multiply-dispatched
            multimethods from mixins, to object-oriented parsing grammars with
            hybrid DFA/NFA rules, to concurrent higher-order functions applied
            over infinite lists of pipelined arbitrary precision integers.</p>

            <p>More importantly, Perl 6 does not restrict you to a single
            paradigm across your entire application; nor within a single
            compilation unit, namespace, block, subroutine, or even statement.
            Instead, you can easily combine and integrate all these functional,
            procedural, declarative, OO, and concurrent constructs within any
            chunk of code, no matter how small, without losing readability or
            efficiency. We call it "transparadigm programming": not five
            separate choices of computation model, but a single computation
            model with five integrated choices.</p>

            <p>In other words, we stole the best features from 20 different
            languages, and then spent over a decade working out how to fit them
            together in a way that is clean, efficient, powerful, and still
            usable by actual human beings. Perl 6 was the result.</p>

                <h5>Course outline</h5>
                <p>In this class, Damian will explain, discuss, and demonstrate
                Perl 6 by examining some of the most interesting
                transparadigmatic features of the language, using familiar
                real-world examples stolen from every Programming 101 class
                you've ever taken.</p>

                <h5>Who should attend</h5>
                <p>This tutorial is designed for those with some experience in
                one or more functional, procedural, declarative, OO, or
                concurrent programming languages. Participants will be expected
                to recognize and understand simple programs for such tasks as
                mean/median/mode calculations, quicksort, mergesort, Fibonacci
                number generation, simple data validation, prime number
                recognition, bank account management, LaTeX parsing, LZW
                compression, and SHA-256 digests.</p>

                leads the new branch of Dancer: Dancer2. He's the current
                project leader and main developer.</p>

                <p>Mickey is a core developer in Dancer2 and has provided some
                of the bigger changes including major overhauls of core
                components, along with massive cleanups of the inner workings
                of Dancer.</p>

            <p>You don't have to use Haskell or Scala or Scheme to start
            reaping the benefits of the functional paradigm.</p>

            <p>Perl 6 is a fully featured functional language, and Perl 5
            offers surprisingly strong support for functional programming as
            well. In fact, if you’re currently coding in either Perl 5
            or Perl 6, you’re almost certainly already doing functional
            programming.</p>

            <p>This class explores many of the fundamental ideas and specific
            techniques of the functional paradigm, and demonstrates how to
            write clean, efficient, and maintainable functional code in either

            <p>Join us for an interactive hands-on course all about Moose, an
            OO system for Perl 5 that provides a simple declarative layer of
            "sugar" on top of a powerful, extensible meta-model.</p>

            <p>With Moose, simple classes can be created without writing any
            subroutines, and complex classes can be simplified. Moose's
            features include a powerful attribute declaration system, type
            constraints and coercions, method modifiers ("before", "after", and
            "around"), a role system (like mixins on steroids), and more. Moose
            also has a vibrant ecosystem of extensions as seen in the variety
            of MooseX:: modules on CPAN.</p>

            <p>This course will cover Moose's core features, go in depth on
            many of them, and explore some of the more powerful MooseX::
            modules available on CPAN.</p>

            <p>This is a hands-on course. Each lecture section is followed by a
            hands-on exercise section where you put what you've just learned
            into practice. The instructor will work with each student
            individually as needed to help you get the most from these
            exercises.</p>

                <p>This class has consistently received excellent evaluations from students who've taken it:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>"I thought Dave's class was outstanding. Well prepared and highly valuable content. This course was one of the best organized I've had the opportunity to take." - Chris Fedde

                    <li>"It damn sure was a good use! It would've been a huge mistake not taking your class; Moose is a magnificent beast and I couldn't have picked a better primer." - Brian Fraser

                    <li>"The class was great. There was a nice balance of material presented to hands-on experimentation, and alternating between lecture and exercises helped nail down concepts." - Philip Monsen

                    <li>"I had never used Moose previously, but the class gave me enough to get started on using Moose. The slide deck was awesome, and the presenter&apos;s mix of exercises and talk was perfect. Since the conference, I&apos;ve started baby steps into using Moose in some of my projects, with good success thus far." - Joel Maslak

                <h5>Required Materials</h5>

                <p>Students are expected to bring a laptop with a recent version of
                Perl and the editor of their choice.  You will also be provided
                with a tarball a week or so before the class is scheduled. This
                will contain the exercises for the class.</p>

                <p>A github link will be provided prior to class that students will
                need to clone.</p>

                <h5>Who Should Attend</h5>

                <p>This class is aimed at Perl programmers who understand
                object-oriented programming and want to learn how to do it with
                Moose. It is not suitable for Perl beginners or for people without
                any OO experience. OO experience in other languages besides Perl is
                sufficient, as long as you also have a good grasp of Perl syntax,
                particularly method call syntax.</p>

                <h5>Speaker Biography</h5>

                <p>Dave Rolsky has been a Perl developer since 1999, and has
                created or contributed to dozens of CPAN modules. He is a
                member of the Moose core development team, and in early 2009
                completed a TPF grant to substantially rewrite and expand the
                Moose documentation. He is also the co-author of Embedding Perl
                in HTML with Mason and RT Essentials.</p>

                <p>He spends a lot of his free time on animal advocacy with
                Compassionate Action for Animals (http://www.exploreveg.org),
                working on a variety of programs including fundraising and
                planning Twin Cities Veg Fest (http://tcvegfest.com).</p>

            <p>As a Perl programmer you can greatly enhance your value by being
            able to build modern, mobile enabled web application. For this it
            is not enough to be able to build the back-end in Perl, you also
            need to know how to build the front-end.</p>

            <p>The primary focus of this course is client-side web
            development.</p>

            <p>You are going to learn how to create a mobile-enabled, responsive web application
            using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>,
            and <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> on the front-end.</p>

            <p>We are going to use Perl for the back-end, but the focus of the
            course is the front-end development.</p>

                <h5>Course outline</h5>
                <p>At the beginning of the course we are going to introduce the
                basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  We'll touch on some of the
                features that are usually mentioned as HTML5 some of which are
                actually part of JavaScript.</p>

                <p>Then we are going to see some of the problems we face when
                we build a the client-side part of a web application and how
                AngularJS solves these problems.</p>

                <p>We are going to take an already existing web-site that
                provides an API sending data formatted as JSON, probably
                MetaCPAN.org and we are going to write a single-page
                client-side application for it.</p>

                <p>Highlights:

                <ul>
                    <li> JavaScript Core
                    <li> Bootstrap

                </ul> </p>

                <p>You will receive training materials in PDF format with
                plenty of example files and lifetime access to the Perl Maven
                Pro subscription service. (Normally $90 / year). </p>

                <h5>Required materials</h5>
                <p>You are expected to bring your own computer running Linux,

                <h5>Who should attend</h5>
                <p>This course is for you if from time to time you need to
                build web applications. Either public facing or in-house. It is
                assumed that you know how to build basic web application in
                either one of the Perl-based frameworks (e.g. Catalyst, Dancer,
                Mojolicious), in pure CGI, or even in some other language.</p>

            <p>The best, most effective presentations capture the audience
            quickly, hold their interest effortlessly, educate and entertain
            them in equal measure, and sometimes even inspire them. This class
            explores simple and effective techniques for achieving those goals
            in any kind of presentation.</p>

            <p>The first half of the course focuses on preparation, content
            selection, delivery techniques, and handling questions (or the lack
            thereof). The second half of the course is an in-depth tutorial on
            improving the "look and feel" of presentation materials--especially
            Powerpoint/Impress presentations. In particular, it demonstrates
            practical techniques for making your slides not suck.</p>

                <p>There are a few million new languages making buzz on the Internet
                these days, and Go is one of them! Go hits a nice sweet spot between
                ease of coding, speed of execution, and modern features such as type
                inferencing, concurrency, and a minimalist but well-designed OO
                system.</p>

                <p>In this class, I'll introduce you to Go basics including syntax, the
                type system, OO in Go, packages and package management, and
                concurrency.</p>

                <p>This is a hands-on course. Each lecture section is followed by a hands-on
                exercise section where you put what you've just learned into practice. The
                instructor will work with each student individually as needed to help you
                get the most from these exercises.</p>

                <p>Students are expected to bring a laptop. You will also be provided with a
                tarball a week or so before the class is scheduled. This will contain the
                exercises for the class.</p>

                <h5>Intended Audience</h5>

                <p>This class is aimed at anyone who wants to learn
                Go. I will assume that you have experience programming in at least one
                other language, but no assumption are made about what language that
                is, nor are you expected to be familiar with Go.</p>

                <p>Supplies Provided: I will provide a tarball via email containing the class
                exercises.</p>

                <p>Supplies Needed: Students are expected to bring a laptop with the most
                recent version of Go installed and an editor of their choice.</p>
