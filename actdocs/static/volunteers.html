<p>Our lead organizer in 2016 is Dan Wright.</p>

<p>Dan arrived on the Perl scene when he landed his first “real job” as a network programmer for pair Networks, Inc. in 2000. At the time, he was finishing up his Bachelor’s degree from the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown. Sixteen years later, Dan is still working for pair as their Director of Technical Operations for pairNIC.com. Dan still works with Perl code on a daily basis.</p>

<p>In 2006, Dan was a founding organizer for the Pittsburgh Perl Workshop, which has run 8 out of the last 10 years. He is the only Pittsburgh Perl Monger to have taken an organizer role in every single PPW. Dan was also served as a lead organizer for YAPC::NA in 2009. In 2010, Dan became the Treasurer for The Perl Foundation and has assisted with the running of every YAPC::NA since then in that capacity.</p>

<p>Brett will be running our Pull Request Challenge on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Brett has been a Perl developer at cPanel for the last 5 years, but has been shamelessly wielding Perl since he was called to it in the very late 90s. He is a member of Houston.pm, a founding member (now expat) of NewOrleans.pm, and an active participant of the CPAN PRC. This is his second YAPC and first year assisting with its organization. </p>

<p>In addition to serving on our SoC committee, Dave has served this year as an adviser to the organizers on all things vegan.</p>

<p>Dave has been a Perl developer since 1999, and has created or contributed to dozens of CPAN modules. In addition to his work with YAPC, he also helped organize the Frozen Perl workshops in Minneapolis. He’s around on IRC as ‘autarch’. Lena asked if he was a little teapot, so he checked, and he is not.</p>

<p>He spends a lot of his free time on animal advocacy with Compassionate Action for Animals, working on a variety of programs including fundraising and planning Twin Cities Veg Fest.</p>

<p>All-around helpful guy, David has been working on the organizer team all year, doing whatever needed to be done.</p>

<p>David has been programming Perl professionally since 1999. Formerly known as 'cogent', he adopted the handle 'Ptolemarch' after being led astray at St. John's College. He would like to remind you that heliocentrism is just a theory. David has recently resurrected Detroit.pm, and serves as its lead organizer. This is David’s first year serving as a YAPC organizer. He is a little teapot; perhaps Karen had the wrong Dave.</p>
